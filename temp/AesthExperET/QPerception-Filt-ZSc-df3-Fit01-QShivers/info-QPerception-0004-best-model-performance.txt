The adjusted ICC only relates to the random effects. 
The unadjusted ICC also takes the fixed effects variances into account. 
More precisely, the fixed effects variance is added to the denominator of 
the formula to calculate the ICC (see Nakagawa et al. 2017). 
# Intraclass Correlation Coefficient

    Adjusted ICC: 0.296
  Unadjusted ICC: 0.270
 
The marginal R-squared considers only the variance of the fixed effects and 
indicates how much of the model's variance is explained by the fixed effects part only. 
The conditional R-squared takes both the fixed and random effects into account and 
indicates how much of the model's variance is explained by the 'complete' model. 
# R2 for Mixed Models

  Conditional R2: 0.357
     Marginal R2: 0.088
